/* SOLUTION */

/* 
Note: I did not think of adding this to mine, but
it was in the solution. I learned that if an image element
is inside of a block-level element like a div, the
text-align: center will ALSO center the image. great trick!

body {
  text-align: center;
}

  /*
  Note: this is how the solution did it. As you can see it
  is much simpler than mine, but this would have only worked
  if I included the additional style to body (as shown in the
  comment above). I'm leaving this here as a note to myself.
